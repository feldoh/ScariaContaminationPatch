# Scaria Contamination Patch

Scaria is essentially just the Zombie Virus. Especially when you make it contagious with the [Scaria Contamination Mod](https://steamcommunity.com/id/riiswa/myworkshopfiles/?appid=294100).

This mod takes that further by aiming to make Scaria more like the Zombie virus. 

It makes scaria sufferers not find their fellows threatening and not threaten their fellows.
This allows for scaria ridden zombie like hordes that don't just turn on each other.

## Berserk
Pawns who go berserk are usually targeted by everyone.
With this patch anyone with scaria is safe so they will no longer consider a berserk pawn a viable target.
This does not apply to your own pawns, only the AI.

This prevents a faction forced scaria turning on itself when the berserk mental states trigger.

## BOOM! Headshot
Scaria is basically the zombie virus and as we all know zombies are weak to headshots.
Any headshot on a pawn with scaria will blow their head off immediately.

This is configurable in the mod settings to protect your own faction and visitors from the instant-kill mechanic.

If you're finding it's happening too often for your liking you can either tune down the chance for an instant kill or increase the cooldown ticks.
Remember at speed 1 there are 60 ticks a second so if you want a critical headshot at most every 10 seconds you'd set it to 600.

## Immunity
There are two new Genes, one to make you a constant scaria carrier (with a surgery to suppress it indefinitely),
and one to make you immune to Scaria.

The immunity gene can be found in the normal way and additionally has an small chance (1% by default) to naturally be added to a pawn when they are cured. This only applies to pawns that were genetic carriers like the carrier gene mutated into a protective one.

You can also find or make Immunix which is a drug much like penoxycyline which can keep your pawns from being infected.
Be warned it isn't particularly common and is quite hard to make, so it's worth saving your doses for when you need them.

## Renaming Scaria (Zombie Virus)
To improve the cohesion of playing with Scaria like the zombie virus this mod adds translations to rename Scaria to Zombie Virus.
If you know of any other mods adding Scaria you'd like to be compatible just ask or better yet make a PR on Github.

Note that the more explicit zombie renames are restricted to only appear if you include a supported mod:
* [Zombiefied (Zombie Apocalypse)](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1541353047)
* [Wa! Skeleton! (Continued)](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2159119022)
* [Zombieland](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=928376710)

### Renaming Scaria (Aggression Spores)
There are more than just your classic zombies wandering around so if you don't have one of the more obvious zombie mods listed above but you do have one of the Fungal centric mods listed below you'll instead get a more fungal themed set of renames.
