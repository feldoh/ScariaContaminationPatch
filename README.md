# ScariaContaminationPatch

Makes Scaria targets not target other Scaria target

## Berserk
Pawns who go berserk are usually targeted by everyone.
With this patch anyone with scaria is safe so they will no longer consider a berserk pawn a viable target.
This does not apply to your own pawns, only the AI.

This prevents a faction forced scaria turning on itself when the berserk mental states trigger.
