# Scaria Contamination Patch

Scaria is essentially just the Zombie Virus. Especially when you make it contagious with the [Scaria Contamination Mod](https://steamcommunity.com/id/riiswa/myworkshopfiles/?appid=294100).

This mod takes that further by aiming to make Scaria more like the Zombie virus. 

It makes scaria sufferers not find their fellows threatening and not threaten their fellows.
This allows for scaria ridden zombie like hordes that don't just turn on each other.

## Berserk
Pawns who go berserk are usually targeted by everyone.
With this patch anyone with scaria is safe so they will no longer consider a berserk pawn a viable target.
This does not apply to your own pawns, only the AI.

This prevents a faction forced scaria turning on itself when the berserk mental states trigger.

## BOOM! Headshot
Scaria is basically the zombie virus and as we all know zombies are weak to headshots.
Any headshot on a pawn with scaria will blow their head off immediately.

This is configurable in the mod settings to protect your own faction and visitors from the instant-kill mechanic.  

## Renaming Scaria
To improve the cohesion of playing with Scaria like the zombie virus this mod adds translations to rename Scaria to Zombie Virus.
If you know of any other mods adding Scaria you'd like to be compatible just ask or better yet make a PR on Github.
