  <NoxiousHaze.description>Infectious haze is caused by micro doses of RNA attaching to pollution particles from nearby world tiles. It slows plant growth, deteriorates exposed items, and reduces mood as well as potentially infecting your colonists.\n\nThe current world tile has a nearby pollution score of {NEARBYPOLLUTION}, calculated by adding up pollution of nearby world tiles. This means that, on average, infectious haze will occur every {MTB} days.</NoxiousHaze.description>
  <NoxiousHaze.startMessage>Infectious haze has begun due to pollution in this region of the world.</NoxiousHaze.startMessage>
  <NoxiousHaze.endMessage>The infectious haze is lifting.</NoxiousHaze.endMessage>
