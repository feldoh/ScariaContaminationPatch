  <Scaria.label>Zombie Virus</Scaria.label>
  <Scaria.description>A disease which causes affected creatures to enter berserk rages seeking flesh. A creature with the zombie virus can be cured through a special medical operation, but it must be downed first. If not treated, the zombie virus kills its host about five days after infection. The disease poisons the flesh and rots the skin, so creatures killed with the zombie virus are often found to be rotten. No sane creature would butcher them for meat or leather.</Scaria.description>
