  <ManhunterPackArrived>A pack of {0}, infected with the zombie virus have entered the area! They will roam the region, hunting for brains.\n\nThey no longer have the mental capacity to understand doors and won't attack them unless they see someone use one. Hide inside and you might survive the night. As they are so focused on brains they also won't recognise powered-off turrets as a threat, so turn your turrets off to save them.\n\nThe {0} will lurch out of the area in one or two days. You can hide and wait them out, or get out there and exterminate the zombie plague.</ManhunterPackArrived>
