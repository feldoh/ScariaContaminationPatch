  <LetterLabelManhunterPackArrived>Infected pack</LetterLabelManhunterPackArrived>
  <ManhunterPackArrived>A pack of {0}, infected have entered the area! They will roam the region, hunting any living being.\n\nThey no longer have the mental
    capacity to understand doors and won't attack them unless they see someone use one. Hide inside and you might survive the night.
    As they are so focused they also won't recognise powered-off turrets as a threat, so turn your turrets off to save them.\n\nThe {0} will naturally wander out of the area in one or two days. You can hide and wait them out, or get out there and exterminate the infected.</ManhunterPackArrived>

  <!-- Ransom demand -->
  <RansomDemand>{1} contacts you on radio. They are holding former colonist {PAWN_labelShort} for ransom.\n\nThey're willing to release {PAWN_objective} back to you in exchange
    for {2} silver.\n\nIf you decline they cannot guarantee they'll want more than your flesh the next time you meet.</RansomDemand>
